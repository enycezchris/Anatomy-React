  description:
    "Thorax, or the Chest, is the superior part of the body located between the neck and the abdomen. It provides a base for the muscle attachment of the upper extremities, the head and neck, the vertebral column, and the pelvis. In addition to participating in respiratory movements, it provides a measure of protection to vital organs including the heart, major blood vessels, and lungs. It is supported by the ribs, breastbone, and spine. A thin muscle called the diaphragm separates the thorax from the abdomen. The thoracic skeleton consists of 12 thoracic vertebrae, 12 pairs of ribs with costal cartilages, and the sternum. The female thorax is generally narrower and shorter than the male equivalent.",
