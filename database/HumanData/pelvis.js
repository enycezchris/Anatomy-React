  description:
    "The pelvis, also known as the pelvic girdle or pelvis region. Comprised of basin-shaped bones that connects the trunk and the legs, supports and balances the trunk, and contains and supports the intestines, the urinary bladder, and the internal sex organs. The pelvis consists of paired hipbones, connected in front at the pubic symphysis and behind by the sacrum; each is made up of three bonesâ€”the blade-shaped ilium, above and to either side, which accounts for the width of the hips; the ischium, behind and below, on which the weight falls in sitting; and the pubis, in front. All three unite in early adulthood at a triangular suture in the acetabulum, the cup-shaped socket that forms the hip joint with the head of the femur (thighbone). The ring made by the pelvis functions as the birth canal in females. The pelvis provides attachment for muscles that balance and support the trunk and move the legs, the hips, and the trunk. In the human infant the pelvis is narrow and non-supportive.",

  maleDescription:
    "The lower part of the abdomen, also called the pelvis region. The male pelvic girdle is narrower and taller as compared to a female's, this allows for the support of a heavier build. The pelvic inlet, also called the 'inferior pelvis aperture(gap/hole)' is more heart-shaped compared to the female's. The subpubic angle ( the angle formed by the paired ischium bones) of the male pelvis is about 70 degrees. ",

  femaleDescription:
    "The lower part of the abdomen, also called the pelvis region. The female pelvic girdle is shorter and wider and also lighter, more delicate than that of a male's. The bones are larger and broader (wider), this allows for the support of 'child-bearing'. The pelvic inlet, also called the 'inferior pelvis aperture(gap/hole)' is much larger and more oval-shaped than a male's. The distance between the paired ischia bones are greater than that of a male's and thus making the gap much larger. The pubic arch of a female's pelvis is greater than 70 degrees (male), it is approximately 90-100 degrees, which gives the 'curvier' appearance.",
