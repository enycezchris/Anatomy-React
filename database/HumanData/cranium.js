    "The human head is home to all the body’s major sensory organs, and the most important of these is the brain.Although the nose, ears, tongue, nerves, and others parts are important, without a healthy brain, they’d all be useless. Encased in the skull, the brain is the body’s centralized conveyor of all information. Much of its job involves receiving information from the rest of the body, interpreting that information, and then guiding the body’s response to it.Input the brain interprets includes odor, light, sound, and pain, and these are gathered from organs located in the head. Major sensory organs located in the head include: Eyes, Ears, Nose, Tongue.",
